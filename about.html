  "Mission Education is a project to provide educational opportunities to disadvantaged children. 
   These children are mostly either homeless, orphaned, abandoned, runaways, or belong to extremely 
   poor families.Many of them have lost precious years of their childhood, working as child labour. 
   At Mission Education centres, they are not only provided education, but also nurtured in a loving 
   and caring environment, conducive for their holistic growth.The Mission Education campaign aims to 
   reach out to the civil society – youth, individuals, institutions to come forward. 
   We can all come together and contribute to Mission Education in whatever way we can – by making a 
   donation, by spreading the word, by volunteering, or through corporate associations. 
   We believes that every action counts!"
